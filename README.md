# studybuddy

So much to learn, so little time. Sometimes studying is a little easier and more enjoyable with a buddy. Find your study buddy with the Study Buddy app.
Study Buddy is an app created to help people interested in various study topics to connect with others interested in the same topics. Users can find those who want to study on the same terms as themselves, as well as can create a favorites page to keep track of their favorite study buddies.

## How to Use
When the user loads the Study Buddy app, they must either log in or create an account. Creating an account requires the user to provide their First Name, Last Name, Username, Password, Email, Location, and a user Photo. The site will not allow the user to search for buddies until logged in. The users individual user information is then stored in a User table in MySQL using Sequelize. 

The user is then prompted to take a survey which captures the users desired Topic, Sub-Topic, if they want to meet Remote or In Person, preferred Meeting Time of day, and then they are presented with the days of the week to individually select which days work best for them. The users survey information is then stored in a Survey table in MySQL. 

Once the user has completed their survey, they will be presented with study buddy matches which are generated by running an algorithm that compares the current users survey results to the results of other users, and then shows those that most closely match the current users results on the Matches page. 

The user has the option to go back via the nav bar and re-take the survey should they want to study a different Topic/Sub-Topic. In order to keep track of past studies buddies, the user has the option to favorite matches. They do this by clicking on the star icon on other users card(s). The favorites information is then stored in a third table called Favorites in MySQL via Sequelize.
The Matches and Favorites pages are both generated based off of the backend tables in MySQL. The user card information is generated by pulling from the MySQL tables. 

The user has the ability to log out, as well as to view an About page with further Study Buddy App details.

## Feedback
This project served as great practice on many of the components used. Passport.js was great for user authentication. Integrating it into the project was a learning experience.

Cloudinary is a SaaS component that was used for capturing user images. It stopped working at one point so we spent a lot of time reviewing the code to see what was wrong, only to learn that it was an issue with our Cloudinary account vs. and issue with our code. 

Our team did a great job planning this project and understanding what the MVP was. We challenged ourselves to use new tools and supported each other through the learning process resulting in an app we are all proud of. 

## TPM
From a project management perspective, this was a wonderful project to work on as the team was highly engaged and involved from planning through deployment. There was an experienced design team member who was incredibly valuable to the team, and it was great getting to work with them and see how different experience and rolls can contribute. Specifically, they asked a lot of questions about how things would link up on the back-end, which overall helped us to think out our design and to have a better project plan prior to starting coding. It stood out because some people may not believe front-end designers should be speaking so much to the back-end, but her input was valid and very helpful. In other words, don’t pigeon hole people because of their role on a project or their job title. If someone can bring value in any way, embrace it, give them a seat at the table, and listen up! 

We had an extensive planning stage for this project that served us well. We had in depth wireframing, detailed lists of MVP and nice-to-haves, and kept a spec doc going at all times to track thoughts, ideas, and anything relevant to the project that wouldn’t live on the Kanban board. The Kanban was managed via GitHub. We had decent participation on the board from all team members throughout the project (please feel free to check it out https://github.com/aprilleperez/studybuddy/projects/1). We used this space for our a.m. and p.m. stand up task recaps, for logging issues, and as a staging ground for future development. This project went smoothly from beginning to end, truly a dream team!
